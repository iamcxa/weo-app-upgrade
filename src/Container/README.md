# Containers

This directory contains [container components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0),
i.e. React components responsible for the logic of the application. **Don't forget to register them in the file
index.js.**, you will most likely use them in the AppScenes.js.

the following containers are built-in in the boilerplate, you can delete them safely(but dont forget to them in
AppScenes.js) if you want to:

- Example
- Splash
